# fitnessCalc
Estimate relative fitness from competition assays based on viable count data

The python code was written by Robert Clegg <roughhawkbit@gmail.com> to analyse viable count data from competition assays to evaluate relative fitness with confidence intervals. The code has been used to analyse data in this preprint:
